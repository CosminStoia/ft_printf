# ft_printf
## Overview
Welcome to ft_printf, a custom implementation of the printf function in C, developed as part of the 42 programming curriculum. This project aims to recreate the functionality of the standard C library's printf function while adhering to the requirements and constraints specified in the project guidelines.

## About

In the ft_printf project, we've implemented a custom version of the printf function from the C standard library. The project challenges students to understand the inner workings of printf, handle various format specifiers, and manage variable argument lists (variadic functions).

## Functions

Our implementation of printf supports a wide range of format specifiers, including:

- %c: Character
- %s: String
- %d, %i: Signed decimal integer
- %u: Unsigned decimal integer
- %x, %X: Hexadecimal integer
- %p: Pointer address
  
And more. For a full list of supported format specifiers, please refer to the project's source code.

## Usage

``make`` to compile the program
